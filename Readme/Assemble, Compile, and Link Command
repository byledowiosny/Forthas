Compile with gcc:

For normal compilation use:

    gcc forthx.s -no-pie -o forthx forthx.c -ludis86 -lm -lquadmath

For debugging use:

    gcc -g -no-pie -o forthx forthx.s forthx.c -ludis86 -lm -lquadmath


Compile with clang:

    as -o forthx.o forthx.s && clang -no-pie -o forthx forthx.o forthx.c -ludis86 -lm -lquadmath

For debugging use:

    as -o forthx.o -g -a >forthx.lst forthx.s && clang -g -no-pie -o forthx forthx.o forthx.c -ludis86 -lm -lquadmath


 Note that to compile Forthx64 with Udis86, the udis86 library must be present, but the compiled program will run on systems without it.
On the other hand, libquadmath0 must be installed to compile or run Forthx64 with the library.
